# Hungarian Algorithm for Images 

This is hungarian algorithm applied on k-means clustering (or you can replace with other clustering algorithms) for Poggies :P. 

The image for Poggies is taken here [site](https://makeameme.org/meme/lachlanpoggies-me-i).

To run the file, simply
```
bash
python hungarian_algorithm.py

```

We refer mostly to this [site](https://things-about-r.tumblr.com/post/36087795708/matching-clustering-solutions-using-the-hungarian) (hungarian algorithm written in R) for implementation details. 

`hungarian_algorithm.ipynb` is a jupyter notebook with the same content as `hungarian_algorithm.py`,
